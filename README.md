express request and get post practice 

We're forwarding all traffic on the domain to our application and letting Express handle the entirety of the routing logic. There is a benefit to thisâ€”I don't have to manually string up all my routes and functions. I can also limit the impact of cold-starts on lightly-used routes.

However, we also lose some of the benefits of the serverless architecture. I can isolate my bits of logic into separate functions and get a decent look at my application from standard metrics. If each route is handled by a different Lambda function, then I can see:

How many times each route is invoked
How many errors I have for each route
How long each route takes (and how much money I could save if I made that route faster)

Now, all requests to GET /users/:userId will be handled by the getUser instance of your application, and all requests to 
POST /users/ will be handled by the createUser instance. For any other requests, they'll be handled by the main app instance of your function.

Again, none of this is required, and it's a bit of an overweight solution since each specific endpoint will include the full application code for your other endpoints. 
However, it's a good balance between speed of development by using the tools you're used to along with the per-endpoint granularity that serverless application patterns provide.

This is a very simple application that returns "Hello World!" when a request comes in on the root path /.

It's straight out of the Express documentation with two small additions. First, we imported the serverless-http package at the top. Second, we exported a handler function which is our application wrapped in the serverless package.
